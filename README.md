- Removed empty rows and columns.
- Standardized column types and labels.
- Separated 2023 and 2024 data into structured monthly records.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Core Segments Held Strong**: Even after excluding fuel and vehicles, retail sales stayed solid.
- **Seasonal Patterns Were Clear**: Sales peaked in spring (Mar–May) and the holidays (Oct–Dec).
- **Forecast for 2025 is Positive**: The model predicts continued growth with similar seasonal peaks.

## 🧠 Recommendations

2. **Campaign Strategy**: Run promotions in slow months like June and September.
3. **Category Focus**: Invest in resilient retail areas like food, clothing, and home goods.
